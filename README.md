# unipika

Common YT/YQL/QC data formatting library.

## format(data[, settings[, converter]])

Function accepts data in Unipika-YSON format (hereinafter referred to as the - Unipika), or, if converter is presented, in any other format and formats data according to its type. Currently two built-in converters are presented:

- YSON to Unipikа
- YQL to Unipika

### Examples

### List of supported types:

| Source format | Types                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| YSON          | `string`, `number`, `int64`, `uint64`, `double`, `map`, `list`, `null`                                                           |
| YQL           | `yql.string`, `yql.int64`, `yql.uint64`, `yql.double`, `yql.struct`, `yql.dict`, `yql.list`, `yql.tuple`, `yql.null`, `yql.yson`, `yql.pg.*` - simple PostgreSQL Data Types in YQL are being formatted as `yql.string` |

Similar in meaning types are displayed similarly. For example, `int64` and `yql.int64`, `map` and `yql.struct`, etc.

It is assumed that types can't be mixed in arbitrary way, that is, for example, `list` can't have elements of type `yql.string`, nevertheless, library doesn't attempt to fix invalid data in this case. When using built-in converter this situation shouldn't happen. Also, for example, only YSON types can have attributes, for the rest of types special field `$attributes` is pointless.

### Formatter settings:

| Name                      | Type                       | Default value                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| normalizeUrl              | `(url: string) => string`  | `(url) => new URL(url).toString()` | Optional pararmeter that allows to override default behavior of `utils.normalizeUrl`. Default implementation uses `encodeURI(url)` and returns empty string if the call throws an exception. The result of call `settings.normalizeUrl(url)` injects to DOM tree "as is" as value of `href`-attributes, so you have to sanitize returned value to prevent XSS.                                                                                                                   |
| validateSrcUrl            | `(url: string) => boolean` | `() => false`                      | Function, which accepts source url for `TaggedType` types and returns whether it is allowed to be downloaded. If settings in not defined, `TaggedType` types (images, audio, video) will be formatted as `StructType`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| format                    | String                     | `'json'`                           | `[YSON-specific]` Affects displaying YSON types. Serialization to text `yson` or `json` is supported. These ways of representation are described in YT documentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Indicated whether to try decode the data. The data received from YT with the setting { encode_utf8 = false } should not be decoded (also is means that all strings are valid UTF-8 sequences, that is, they are not binary). By default the data from YT is received with the setting { encode_utf8 = true } and should be decoded; strings that cannot be decoded are marked as binary. |

`[YQL-Converter]` - Options affects only data conversion from YQL format.
`[YSON-Converter]` - Options affects only data conversion from YSON format.
`[YSON-Specific]` - Options affects only YSON types representation and should not affect other types representation.
`[NCP]` - (Non copy-pastable) this representation is used to improve readability, but is not valid; copying and using such data may cause an error.

## formatFromYSON(data[, settings])

Format function wrapper, data is passed in YSON format, YSON to Unipika converter is used.

## formatFromYQL(data[, settings])

Format function wrapper, data is passed in YQL format (in the list `[data, dataType]`), YQL to Unipika converter is used.

## TODO

Plugins `yql-date`, `yql-datetime` and `yql-timestamp` do formatting of date by `Date.prototype.toISOString()`.
If it is required it is better to use `moment.js` and rewrite the plugins.
